# Map Graph

Map graph is a Java application which implements the concepts of graph to create a clone of the Google Maps. It uses the Google Maps API along with graph traversal algorithms such as Breadth First Search(BFS), Dijkstra and A* Search to find the shortest path between two destinations.

## Getting Started

You can setup a local instance for this application and run it for yourself:

### Prerequisites

The only pre-requisite for running this application is a Java IDE. I used [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) while developing this and therefore the screenshots attached here are from Eclipse. 

### Installation

Clone the repository on your local machine and import it into your preferred IDE. On Eclipse, you can do this via the following path:
```
File > Import > General > Existing Projects in Workspace
```

## Running Locally

Run the application by executing ".java", this file can be found under the following path:
```
UCSDGraphs > src > application > MapApp.java
```

**Note:** The app works but there seems to be an issue with Google Maps API. Will try to fix this in future.
